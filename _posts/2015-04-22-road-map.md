> **Current Status:** <br/>
> Just a simple threeJS scene is initialized and connected to a Python backend using WebSocket. On the other hand, the Python backend is managing a SmartBody scene and handling WebSocket requests*


#### Near future

- Use Tornado as Python framework to serve WebSocket
- Send SmartBody scene updates upstream to threeJS scene (especially create characters)
- Remove threading from SmartBody scene worker and use it in completely separate process, while still using ZMQ for synchronization with WebSocket


#### Future

- Integrate with WebTundra
- Synchronize WebTundra scene and SmartBody
- Implement Users Avatars (create new characters from threeJS)
- When implementing multiple users, use one skeleton and just different meshes for different users. SmartBody engine doesn't need to be aware of how Brads actually look like
- Implement NodeJS module wrapping SmartBody API
- Compile bare SmartBody engine with minimal dependencies and prepare it for possible `emscripten` trip
- Try to compile the inevitably required Boost libraries into AsmJS using `emscripten`
